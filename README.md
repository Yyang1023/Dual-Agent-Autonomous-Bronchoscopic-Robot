# Dual-Agent Autonomous Bronchoscopic Robot

### Code for "A Dual-Agent Learning Framework Enables Level 3+ Autonomous Robotic Bronchoscopy"

📋 **Status:** The complete project details have been submitted through the manuscript review system. Full project documentation and comprehensive codebase will be released following manuscript acceptance.

---

## 🎮 Demo

Here we provide a **simulation demo** that can be run without physical robotic hardware. This demo allows reviewers to verify the core autonomous capabilities and inference logic described in the manuscript.
* **File:** `CodeForReviewDemo.zip`
* **Password:** The extraction password is the **Manuscript ID** (format with `NCOMMS-xx-xxxxxx`) which can be found in the peer review system.

### Demo Contents
The demo package includes a standalone environment to visualize the autonomous navigation:
1.  **Virtual Bronchoscopy Environment:** A synthetic airway environment for testing.
2.  **Pre-trained Models:** Checkpoints for the navigator and driver agent.
3.  **Testing Script:** A one-click script to run the dual-agent loop.
4.  **Setup Guide:** A `README_DEMO.md` inside the zip file with quick installation steps (requires only Python & PyTorch).
